                    The most common way to watch movies through your TV is through your smart TV. A smart TV is a flat-screen device that incorporates an internet connection to your TV. The device provides you with the ability to download apps according to your preference, and from there you can begin creating an account to access movies.

                    Called 4K and marketed often as UHD (ultra-high-definition television), this resolution is technically 3840 x 2160 pixels. It looks quite similar to 2K to most viewers but gives filmmakers more room to zoom in and edit.
